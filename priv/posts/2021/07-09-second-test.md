### Things learnt
* The atoms `nil` and `false` are treated as `falsy` values, whereas everything else is treated as a `truthy` value.

* The basics of types are done but others like `keyword lists` and `MapSets` are yet to be done.

### What I could not do yet?
* make this page work via NimblePublish although the 'page' showing list of all blogs is visible.
